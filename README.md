# OEE Analysis Dashboard using SQL & Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) to evaluate machine efficiency in a manufacturing environment.  
The dashboard helps identify performance losses caused by low availability, speed issues, or quality defects.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Manufacturing teams often struggle to understand why machine efficiency is low.  
This project breaks down OEE into Availability, Performance, and Quality to identify root causes and support data-driven decisions.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- SQL (Data cleaning, aggregation, calculations)
- Power BI (DAX, dashboards, visualization)
- Excel / CSV (Data source)

## 📊 Key Metrics
- Availability (%)
- Performance (%)
- Quality (%)
- Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)

## 📈 Dashboard Features
- KPI Cards for overall metrics
- OEE trend analysis by machine
- Shift-wise OEE comparison
- Machine vs Shift heatmap
- Interactive slicers for date, shift, and machine

## 📌 Key Insights
- High quality alone does not guarantee high OEE
- Availability is the biggest factor affecting efficiency
- Night shifts showed lower performance
- Machine M003 requires immediate attention
